        <p>My fresh new portfolio website with a new content delivery system that I developed. It's a "Single page
          application" as the boys like to call it with session history and Internal router. </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Why waste time on the same website?</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>At the beginning of 2018 I started taking an interest in programming, and started with vanilla JavaScript,
          HTML 5 and CSS 3, the first few months was very confusing but I got over it. It took me some time to develop
          a really good learning strategy and I started to pick up the pace. My first project was to build my very own
          website with my own code (after years working with WordPress and Wix websites).</p>
        <p>So it was a very nice try I believe, for my first real website including the design.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Today with my new knowledge in JavaScript, and programming logic in general, I wanted to build a new and
          better website. So I built this shahary.com 2.0. Instead of using simple HTML files to navigate between them
          I use javascript to inject all the content to this base HTML structure. Similar to the functionality of
          Express ejs or React with Nodejs server that I use in the project - Get a peek.</p>
        <p>But of course, I chose this approach with the simple and basic Apache shared hosting server that the website
          is hosted on. </p>
        <p>For the best performance, I use AJAX XMLHttpRequest to fetch the files for every page or section. Most of
          the logos are SVG or PNG format for the lowest size possible, the green logos on the navbar are my own
          design. </p>
        <p>For the heavy images, I use hot links from GitHub, I already uploaded them for their own repository pages so
          its just to save some bandwidth for the server. </p>
        <p>Now the new website is very easy to maintain, with one main "menu" js file that manages all the content
          flow.</p>
        <p>In the GitHub repository, you will find all the files on the server + local Nodejs server that I use for the
          testing phase. </p>
